# Git Practice

1. [Agile DevOps](https://www.toolbox.com/tech/devops/articles/why-agile-devops-is-now-the-default-standard-for-software-development/)

   It might be interesting to someone who wants to know the current trends of Agile Development and DevOps, and how companies are combining these two as the new development approach.

2. It makes no sense to replace the DevOps methodology with Agile at a time when the former is undergoing continuous refinement to attune to the needs of different organizations. This is why DevOps experts advocate the use of Agile and DevOps processes in tandem to enable developers to get the best out of both approaches.

### Comments from Corey Dubin

<p>I think it will be interesting to think about the longevity of the Agile methodology. If it is as adaptive as it is, and is able to accommodate supplementary business practices, it could be a mainstay for not only the IT sector, but many other sectors (the article discusses the increasing amount of non-software companies implementing the Agile framework).</p>
